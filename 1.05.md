Note that for the following procedure:

(define (p) (p))

When we call p, we get #<procedure p> as the result. However, calling (p) will result in infinite recursion, as p recursively calls itself.

In applicative-order evaluation, when (p) is evaluated, the code gets stuck in an infinite recursion. On the other hand, in normal-order evaluation, (p) is not immediately evaluated, and the result will be 0.
