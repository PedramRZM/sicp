if is a special form in lisp. meaning no matter interpreter is using applicative order or normal order, it evaluates one of its parameters. when we use new-if, sqrt-iter is recursively defined

To be even clearer: The act of re-defining a special form using generic arguments effectively "De-Special Forms" it. It then becomes subject to applicative-order evaluation, such that any expressions within the consequent or alternate portions are evaluated regardless of the predicate. In Ex 1.6, the iteration procedure is called without return and eventually overflows the stack causing an out of memory error.
