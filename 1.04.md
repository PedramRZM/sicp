Certainly! Let's break down the behavior of this procedure step by step:

1. The procedure is named `a-plus-abs-b` and takes two parameters, `a` and `b`.

2. The body of the procedure consists of a single expression:
   `((if (> b 0) + -) a b)`

3. This expression is a combination where the operator itself is a compound expression:
   `(if (> b 0) + -)`

4. This compound expression is an if statement that:
   - Checks if `b` is greater than 0
   - If true, it evaluates to the `+` operator
   - If false, it evaluates to the `-` operator

5. The result of this if statement (either `+` or `-`) becomes the operator for the outer combination, which then applies to the operands `a` and `b`.

6. So, the behavior of the procedure is as follows:
   - If `b` is positive (> 0), it returns `a + b`
   - If `b` is zero or negative (â‰¤ 0), it returns `a - b`

In effect, this procedure always adds the absolute value of `b` to `a`. Here's why:
- When `b` is positive, adding `b` is the same as adding its absolute value.
- When `b` is negative, subtracting `b` is mathematically equivalent to adding its absolute value.

For example:
- `(a-plus-abs-b 3 5)` would return 8 (3 + 5)
- `(a-plus-abs-b 3 -5)` would also return 8 (3 - (-5), which is 3 + 5)

This procedure cleverly uses the ability to have compound expressions as operators to implement the absolute value addition without explicitly using an abs function.
